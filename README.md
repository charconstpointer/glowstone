# glowstone 🌟

### glowstone allows other people to join your localhost games 🎢

### if you're familiar with services like https://aternos.org/ you know that queues can get ridicolous
### with glowstone you can just host your own server and let other people join it via glowstone proxy/tcp mux
### for now you have to host the proxy yourself, but even smallest vm will suffice which is not true for mc servers
